Around five thousand of the pieces are posters. These were printed in colour and black-and-white by typography, screen printing, xylography (woodcut relief) and offset printing techniques on paper of various weights, formats and sizes, such as letter, legal, double letter, double legal and ‘mercurio’. The remaining three thousand items are cards, postcards, bulletins, event invitations, pamphlets, leaflets, books and poetry. Tallersol was the most productive graphic workshop in Santiago and the most enduring, as it continues its campaigns to commemorate resistance to dictatorship today. This digital collection includes an initial set of 150 posters, all created by artist Antonio Kadima.","El Centro Cultural Tallersol fue fundado en 1977 en Santiago de Chile por un colectivo de artistas y activistas culturales y políticos que resistieron la represión militar creando un espacio para la creatividad y experimentación artística bajo la dictadura de Pinochet de 1973-1990. En ese periodo, produjeron alrededor de nueve mil afiches, folletos y otros documentos para organizaciones de derechos humanos, políticas, sociales y culturales. Hasta ahora, el papel del arte gráfico en las redes de resistencia contracultural durante la dictadura es poco conocido y estudiado. Por eso, nuestro proyecto ha iniciado el trabajo de catalogar y digitalizar el archivo de Tallersol para democratizar el acceso al público echo investigadores. // The Tallersol Cultural Center was founded in 1977 in Santiago de Chile by a collective of artists and cultural and political activists who resisted military repression by creating a space for creativity and artistic experimentation under the Pinochet dictatorship from 1973-1990. In that period, they produced around 9,000 posters, brochures and other documents for human rights, political, social and cultural organizations. Until now, the role of graphic art in countercultural resistance networks during the dictatorship is little known and studied.","","","","posters","spa","","Taller de Gráfica (Graphic Design Workshop)","","Antonio Kadima","El Centro Cultural Tallersol","","copyrighted","unpublished","antonio.kadima@gmail.com","Digitization for the Centro Cultural Tallersol collection was sponsored by the Modern Endangered Archives Program with funding from Arcadia.","","Modern Endangered Archives Program","Chile","","Political posters, Chilean--History--20th century|~|Government, Resistance to--Posters--Chile|~|Graphic arts--Chile--History--20th century|~|Affiches politiques chiliennes--Histoire--20e siècle|~|Résistance au gouvernement--Affiches--Chili","https://iiif.library.ucla.edu/collections/ark%3A%2F21198%2Fz1cz7hzc"
